Description: This package provides bindings to the generic input event interface in Linux.
 The evdev interface serves the purpose of passing events generated in the 
 kernel directly to userspace through character devices that are typically 
 located in /dev/input/.This package also comes with bindings to uinput, 
 the userspace input subsystem. Uinput allows userspace programs to create 
 and handle input devices that can inject events directly into the input 
 subsystem.
